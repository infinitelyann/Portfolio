            <p> 
                I'm Stephanie, a Full-Stack Software Engineer.
                I graduated from General Assembly's 12 week Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp on December 2nd, 2022.
                <br/>
                I have a natural attraction to leadership and teamwork. 
                <br/>
                Let's see what we can come up with together!
